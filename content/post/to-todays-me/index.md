My major life event probably will be decided to work as a software engineer instead of sticking back to my university major, Mechatronics Engineering. 

Back to the university day, I was a lazy person who not having a high scoring in the exam but I still pass the exam so that it wont delay my year of study. And in my third year of degree life, I met and fall in love with with my current girlfriend and that is the moment where I felt my life has a purpose and I wanted to do something to make me life become better and stronger.

So I started to take my academic more seriously as well as improve my socialize skill such as talking to the stranger, building my networking and etc. One day, I was sit down in library and asking myself. 

*“What am I going to do after I graduated. Am I really passionate about what I’m studying right now?”* 
<br/>  Then I come out with a conclusion where I’m not hating what I’m studying right now. In contrast, I’m also not really passionate what I’m doing right now.

Fortunately, I was given a web development task during my internship and I struggle a lot because my skills is not compatible yet **BUT** in the meantime I’m really enjoy what I’m doing. After I ended my 3 months internship, I decided to do lot of self learning about programming skills by enrolling into **online course**, watch tutorial from **Youtube**, taking exercise from **FreeCodeCamp** and etc.

I started apply software engineer position after I graduated in Feb 2020 and I couldn’t believe that I was offered with a Web Developer role from an E-commerce company. Until today, I got no regret with the decision I made in last year and I really enjoy what I’m doing in my work.
